        <h2>Description o' S'mores</h2>
        <p>In my kitchen, you won't see a single s'more, ever. Why? I believe in the authentic s'more: one crisped and blackened to gooey perfection in the heat of a handmade campfire. 
        In my kitchen, there are no fires, therefore no s'mores. That's just me. You do you. Perhaps you enjoy a microwave-melted, crispless marshmallow.. a gooey blob upon your cracker of graham, 
        consumed under your dimmable LED kitchen lights. Not I! I believe in the heart of the s'more, a flavor which is only tasted in the open air of night. Come with me! Follow my recipe, and I 
        will deliver you not only choclate, graham, and marshmallow.. I will deliver you a taste of <em>joy.</em> </p>
